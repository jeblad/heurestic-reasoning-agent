ADDITIONAL TERMS
----------------

*The following should be preserved in the legal notices.*

The software may imply some risks of agents veering away from intended purposes. To counteract this the software has mechanisms for signaling the agents clear and explicit commands. Removing those `kill switches <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch>`_ will put users and bystanders in danger, and is not advisable.

In particular, do not to use or operate the software in areas such as airplanes, nuclear, military, finance, banking, or heavy machinery, or connected to or embedded within any system that may operate or control devices within such areas. A kill switch may create catastrophic failures in those cases.

For these cases you should probably implement a `deterministic system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system>`_, or at least with `explainable artificial intelligence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence>`_. This software does not provide such systems.

*The following should be considered in the attribution notices.*

The open source code is provided under the `Norwegian Copyright Law <https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-40>`_(LOV-2018-06-15-40, åndsverksloven) and full author attribution should be given for any contribution of reasonable size. Still, authors may object to certain edits, and thereby deny attribution, thus blocking otherwise valid reuse of modified code.

Additional terms
----------------

*The following should be preserved in the legal notices.*

The software may imply some risks of agents veering away from intended purposes. To counteract this the software has mechanisms for signaling the agents clear and explicit kill commands. Do not use or operate the software in areas, or connected to or embedded within any system that may operate or control devices within areas, where a `kill switch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch>`_ may create catastrophic failures. If the kill switch is removed or overridden in any way, then a permanent indemnification in clear text by audio and/or visual means according to 7f of the license must be provided.

*The following should be considered in the attribution notices.*

The open source code is provided under the `Norwegian Copyright Law <https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-15-40>`_ (LOV-2018-06-15-40, åndsverksloven) for the original authors, and full author attribution should be given for any contribution of reasonable size as good practice dictates if naming is practically possible. This is according to 7b of the license. Still, authors may object to certain edits due to `åndsverksloven §5 <https://lovdata.no/lov/2018-06-15-40/§5>`_, and thereby deny attribution as a consequence, thus blocking otherwise valid reuse of modified code.

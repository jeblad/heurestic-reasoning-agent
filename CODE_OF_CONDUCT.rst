Code of Conduct
===============

Whether youʼve come to ask questions on issues, or to generously share what you know, remember that weʼre all here to learn and code together. Be welcoming and patient, especially with those who may not know everything you do. Oh, and bring your sense of humor, and Iʼll try using mine too. Just in case.

*In a nutshell: Be nice!*

That basically covers it, but these points may help:

  1. Rudeness and belittling language are not okay. Your tone should match the way youʼd talk in person with someone you respect and whom you want to respect you. If you donʼt have time to say something politely, just leave it for someone who does.

  2. Be welcoming, be patient, and assume good intentions. Donʼt expect others to know all the rules — they donʼt. And be patient while they learn. If youʼre here for help, make it as easy as possible for others to help you. Everyone here is volunteering, and no one responds well to demands for help.

  3. Donʼt be a jerk. These are just a few examples. If you see them, flag them:
      - Name-calling. Focus on the problem you (and we) try to solve, not the person. 
      - Bigotry of any kind. No, you donʼt need examples, just donʼt.
      - Inappropriate language or attention. This is not a dating place.
      - Harassment and bullying. If you see a hostile interaction, flag it.

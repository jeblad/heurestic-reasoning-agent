# Be Nice

Whether you've come to ask questions on issues, or to generously share what you know, remember that we’re all here to learn and code together. Be welcoming and patient, especially with those who may not know everything you do. Oh, and bring your sense of humor, and I'll try using mine too. Just in case.

That basically covers it, but these points may help:

  1. Rudeness and belittling language are not okay. Your tone should match the way you'd talk in person with someone you respect and whom you want to respect you. If you don't have time to say something politely, just leave it for someone who does.

  2. Be welcoming, be patient, and assume good intentions. Don't expect others to know all the rules — they don't. And be patient while they learn. If you're here for help, make it as easy as possible for others to help you. Everyone here is volunteering, and no one responds well to demands for help.

  3. Don't be a jerk. These are just a few examples. If you see them, flag them:
      * Name-calling. Focus on the problem you (and we) try to solve, not the person. 
      * Bigotry of any kind. No, you don't need examples, just don't.
      * Inappropriate language or attention. This is not a dating place.
      * Harassment and bullying. If you see a hostile interaction, flag it.

# Contributing to this repository

To make it short; yes you can contribute, but note that the licensing is not common for an open source project. The Norwegian Copyright Law is basically Creative Commons by Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs, but with some leeway on what you can do with the code without bugging me.

Some files in the repo has other licenses. In particular files from Pywikibot have a MIT license.

If you want to share your contributions, the way to do it is to create your own clone of the repository and make pull requests from branches you create in your own repository. Please respect use of linters, and you should also check your own code.

Note that I might choose at some point to change the license for the whole or parts of the repository. The change will most likely be to AGPL.

# Contributing to this repository

To make it short; yes you can contribute! The management system uses `AGPL-3.0-only`, to make sure the code stay open and free, but other subsystems may use other licenses. In particular the models use non-standard licenses, that may seem alien.

If you want to share your contributions, the way to do it is to create your own clone of the repository and make pull requests from branches you create in your own repository. Please respect use of linters, and you should also check your own code.

Note that I might choose at some point to change the license for the whole or parts of the repository.
